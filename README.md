# Memorioso

Soon, most of the content accessible to us will have been created by machines. The space for human-created texts,
stories, novels, publications, articles, and pictures will shrink dramatically. Storing and preserving them will
become significantly more challenging. Our mission is to ensure human creativity thrives in the future by empowering
individuals to create, sign, share, verify, archive and pay for content made by other humans in a fully decentralized
and permissionless way. So simple. So important.

The first iteration of Memorioso is built on [World](https://world.org/), the real human network.

*Memorioso is currently in the [Make It Work](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-the-make-it-work-stage-wh-2iYhHhS4T9CCGkfezjDqwA) stage.*
